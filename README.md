# Online-Car-Dealership-using-MERN

This project is an online car dealership where users can view various car models and book a test drive for their preferred model.
The project uses Reactjs for the front-end and MongoDB along with Express and Node to create a database to store user details.
The application also has a "Book a test drive" feature where users can book a slot to test drive a car.

# FRONTEND

1. Run 'npm install' on the terminal to install all the necessary dependencies.
2. Run 'npm start' to start the frontend of the web application.


# BACKEND

To get started with the backend,
1. Install mongodb and MongoDB compass for easy visualization of the database.
2. Create a database called 'Customers' and 2 collections : 'users' and 'cars'.
3. Copy the data in "CarData.json" into the 'cars' collection as it is this data that gets fetched and displayed on the webpage.
4. The 'users' collection stores the data entered by the user.
5. Once the above mentioned steps have been completed, run 'npm install' to install the dependencies and 'node server.js' to start the server.
